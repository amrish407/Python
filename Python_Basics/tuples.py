l = [100,200,300]       #LISTS
t = (100,200,300)       #TUPLES

#the only difference between tuple and list is that, list is declared by [] while tuple is declared by 
# the (). And we can add value externally in lists but we can't add value in tuples.
#Examples

l.append(600)
#t.append(600)       i have comment this bcoz it will not work as per the rules

print(l)
print(t)
